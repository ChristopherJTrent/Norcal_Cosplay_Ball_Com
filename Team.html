                Daniel Lee Tran (or just "Dan") is a Professional ballroom dancer
            and is in charge of the technical side behind the Cosplay Ball.
            Despite many accolades under his belt, including a United
            States/World Cup title and various teaching awards, Dan's biggest
            passion is getting people to dance for the sake of experiencing
            their own personal growth. Cosplay Ball has provided him the
            unique opportunity to combine his expertise in partner dancing
            with his love for Anime and Gaming and provide the best dance
            education to a young and inspired audience. </span>
